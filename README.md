# Calculator
Basic calculator with Python using tkinter, (Doesn't use the `eval()` function)
## Requirements:
tkinter: `pip install Iv tkinter==3.8`
## The Story Behind
I was out of ideas and going to make a calculator which uses the `eval()` function. After talking to some people on the Python Discord I decided the challange was to do it without the function.
## Issues
Cannot handle negatve numbers (UNSOLVED)
